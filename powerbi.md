# Infrabel Train Punctuality Project

## Creating Reports and Dashboard Templates (Power BI)


### A. Dashboard Overview

The final Power BI report includes several pages, each focused on a different aspect of train punctuality:

- **Executive Overview:** KPI cards (On-Time Performance, Average Arrival/Departure Delay, Total Trains, etc.) and a line chart showing monthly trends.

- **Temporal Analysis:** Detailed analysis of delays by day, hour, and quarter.

These pages allow users to slice and dice the data dynamically using filters such as date ranges, train operator, station, and time of day.

### B. Connecting Power BI to AWS Athena: A Step-by-Step Guide

Below is the detailed process I followed based on best practices and guided by Matthew Yu [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKdCr6vmq-o) tutorials to connect Power BI to our AWS Athena data warehouse:

#### 1. ***Install the AWS Athena ODBC Driver***
- **Download:** Visit the [AWS Athena ODBC driver page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-odbc.html) and download the appropriate driver for your operating system.
- **Install:** Run the installer and follow the instructions to install the driver on your machine.

#### 2. ***Configure the ODBC Data Source (DSN)***
- **Open ODBC Data Source Administrator:** On your Windows machine, open the "ODBC Data Source Administrator" (choose the 64-bit version if using Power BI Desktop 64-bit).
- **Add a New DSN:**
  - Click on the "System DSN" or "User DSN" tab, then click "Add."
  - Select the **AWS Athena ODBC Driver** from the list.
- **Configure DSN Settings:**
  - **Data Source Name:** Provide a meaningful name (e.g., `Athena_DS`).
  - **AWS Region:** Enter the region where your Athena database is hosted (e.g., `eu-west-1` or the appropriate region).
  - **S3 Staging Directory:** Provide the S3 bucket path where Athena stores query results (e.g., `s3://your-athena-output-bucket/path/`).
  - **Authentication:** Enter your AWS Access Key and Secret Key or configure your profile if supported.
  - **Advanced Settings:** You may also set additional parameters if needed (timeout, SSL settings, etc.).
- **Test the DSN:** Use the "Test" button (if available) to ensure that the connection is successful.

#### 3. ***Connect Power BI Desktop to AWS Athena***
- **Launch Power BI Desktop:** Open Power BI Desktop on your machine.
- **Get Data:**  
  - Click on **Home > Get Data**.
  - In the Get Data window, search for or select **ODBC** as the data source.
- **Select DSN:**
  - In the ODBC connector window, choose the DSN you just configured (`Athena_DS`).
  - Click **OK**.
- **Navigator Window:**  
  - Power BI will retrieve the list of available tables from your Athena database.
  - Select the tables (or entire database) you need for your dashboard (e.g., FactTrain, DimDate, DimTrain, DimStation).
  - Click **Load** or **Transform Data** if you need to perform additional data shaping in Power Query.

#### 4. ***Build the Data Model***
- **Relationships:**  
  - In the Power BI Model view, verify that the relationships between your fact and dimension tables are correctly established. Adjust as necessary.
- **Calculated Columns and Measures:**  
  - Create calculated columns or DAX measures (such as Average Delay, On-Time Performance, etc.) to support your analysis.
- **Data Refresh:**  
  - Configure scheduled refresh settings in Power BI Service (if publishing the report) to ensure that the dashboard reflects up-to-date data from Athena.

#### 5. ***Create the Dashboard***
- **Design the Layout:**  
  - Using the Power BI canvas, design your pages as outlined in the Overview. Use a consistent color palette and clear fonts.
- **Add Visuals:**  
  - Insert KPI cards, line charts, bar/column charts, maps, and tables to represent key performance indicators and trends.
- **Interactivity:**  
  - Add slicers for Date, Train Operator, and Station to allow users to filter the data dynamically.
- **Final Touches:**  
  - Add titles, tooltips, and descriptive text boxes to explain each visualizationâ€™s purpose.

#### 6. ***Publish and Share***
- **Publish:**  
  - Once the report is complete, publish it to the Power BI Service.
- **Sharing and Collaboration:**  
  - Configure user access, dashboards, and report sharing options so that stakeholders can view and interact with the dashboard.
